## Who Organized is made for?

The app is available to all congregation members ‚Äî elders, ministerial servants, pioneers, publishers, and even midweek meeting students ‚Äî ensuring everyone can benefit from its features. However, be sure to first get approval from your body of elders, as local circumstances and directions may vary.

## Device compatibility

Organized is designed as a Progressive Web Application (PWA), offering a seamless cross-platform experience. This makes it ideal for all users, and especially for users with less powerful devices or those using less common operating systems. A major benefit is that there is no operation system-lock, meaning you aren‚Äôt restricted to specific platforms or devices. This means it can run directly from your browser without needing to install anything, but you still have the option to add it to your device for easier access and offline use. PWAs combine the best of both web and native apps, making them fast, reliable, and convenient across multiple devices and platforms. As long as you have a modern web browser, you can run Organized smoothly on a smartphone, tablet, or computer with almost any OS.

To enhance your experience, you can also install Organized on your device. This adds an icon to your home screen, provides offline functionality, and offers a more app-like experience, similar to native apps. Simply open the app in your device‚Äôs browser and follow the prompt to add it to your home screen (or click More/Share button ‚Üí Install).

## Is Organized a web-based app?

The Organized app is not a typical online or cloud-based app. While it can be accessed via a web browser, it can also be downloaded and used locally on your device. The app is designed to store all data directly on your device, ensuring that your information remains in your hands and you can access the app offline.

An online server connection is only required for login purposes and to organize data sharing between congregation members. This connection is securely encrypted, guaranteeing the protection of your data. In essence, the Organized app combines the convenience of web access with the security and local storage of a downloaded application.

All app data is stored just on your device initially. The data will be synced via a secure cloud connection if you want to share your schedules with your congregation or use Organized on multiple devices. The app doesn't store any confidential information, so it's never sent to the Internet. The data required for synchronization is end-to-end encrypted, ensuring that neither the Organized app team nor anyone on the Internet can access it. In addition, all the data has multiple layers of data encryption on your device (so it's always encrypted before it gets synced) and various security measures like two-factor authentication, congregation data encryption, one-time invitation codes, app PIN, and more!

In accordance with GDPR, we collect only the most basic user data needed for authentication (such as name, email, device ID, and IP address) and process it with the utmost care. We obtain your consent for data collection, ensure its usage is transparent, and limit it to what is necessary. Users have the right to access, correct, and delete any of their data as required by GDPR.

## New features in development

We're working hard to help you manage your congregation tasks easily ‚ù§Ô∏è. Our goal is to create an app that covers all aspects of congregation life and ministry. While many features are already available, there are still plenty more we plan to add:

‚Ä¢ Territories management <br>
‚Ä¢ Public witnessing <br>
‚Ä¢ Meeting duties scheduling <br>
‚Ä¢ Field service meeting scheduling and viewing <br>
‚Ä¢ Hall cleaning scheduling <br>
‚Ä¢ Congregation activities <br>
‚Ä¢ More printed schedules and forms (like S-12, S-13, S-99, and more) <br>
‚Ä¢ Advanced collaboration features for circuit overseers <br>
‚Ä¢ Wrapper apps for popular operating systems that will help users easily find and download the app as a native application from the app stores.

We're excited to add these new features and more! Development takes time, but if you're a web development enthusiast and want to help out, we'd love to have you on board. Together, we can make the app better for our worldwide brotherhood!
