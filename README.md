However, we kindly suggest discussing its use with your body of elders, as local circumstances and directions may vary.

## What are the device requirements to use Organized?

Organized is a Progressive Web Application (PWA), meaning that it can function in any modern browser. Additionally, the app can be 'installed' on your home screen, providing quicker access and a better user experience.

## Real-world benefits of using the app

üòå **Less stress** ‚Äì Publishers always know when they have assignments, and where to find all schedules and events. Appointed brothers have so much help with their duties, that they complete their tasks more easily, therefore with more joy.

üå≥ **Digitalization** ‚Äì Less paper and ink waste for publishers and appointed brothers. Quicker updates of information for the whole congregation, more precise calculations, and less dependence on specific appointed brothers and their presence today.

üì±Ô∏è **Convenience** ‚Äì Enjoy full functionality seamlessly on any device ‚Äì whether it's mobile or desktop. Organized allows publishers and appointed brothers to use the app on any device, anywhere. You can access the app either from a web browser or install it for the best experience.

All app data is stored just on your device initially. If you want to share your schedules with your congregation or use Organized on multiple devices, the data will be synced via a secure cloud connection. The app doesn't store any confidential information, so it's never sent to the Internet. The data required for synchronization is end-to-end encrypted, ensuring that **neither the Organized app team nor anyone on the Internet can't access it**.

## Available in many languages
[![Crowdin](https://badges.crowdin.net/organized/localized.svg)](https://crowdin.com/project/organized)

Currently, the app is fully or partially available in **20 languages**, including `English`, `Spanish`, `Portuguese`, `French`, `German`, `Italian`, `Polish`, `Japanese`, `Russian`, `Chinese`, `Ukrainian`, `Malagasy`, and even more to come. If you'd like to contribute by translating Organized into the language of your heart, you're very welcome to do so!


The translation for the Organized app is handled at our [Crowdin project page](https://crowdin.com/project/organized) and is pretty easy. The whole app can be translated just in a few days. To learn more about how to help with localization, please read the [translation guide](./TRANSLATION.md). If your language hasn't been added to Crowdin yet, feel free to [create a new issue](https://github.com/sws2apps/organized-app/issues/new?assignees=&labels=i18n&projects=&template=new_language_request.yml) to include your specific language.

## New features in development 
We're working hard on the new redesigned release in the new separate `main-next` branch _(the current `main` branch contains an old, but fully functional version of the app)_. And there are so many features we want to implement:

‚Ä¢ Territories management <br>
‚Ä¢ Meeting duties scheduling <br>
‚Ä¢ Field service meeting scheduling and viewing <br>
‚Ä¢ Upcoming events <br>
‚Ä¢ Hall cleaning scheduling <br>
‚Ä¢ Congregation activities <br>
‚Ä¢ More printed schedules and forms (like S-12, S-13, S-140 variations, and more) <br>

We're excited about adding these and many more new features! Of course, it takes time to develop them... If you know programming and want to help, we'd really appreciate it! Together we can create a better app for the brotherhood across the whole globe!
