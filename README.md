## Who Organized is made for?

Organized takes an elder-first approach: once the body of elders approves and sets up your congregation in the app, they can invite other appointed brothers, publishers and midweek students. Please note that without that approval and setup, others can‚Äôt use Organized on their own. 

> [!CAUTION]
> Before using the app, be sure to obtain approval from your body of elders and review the guidance from your local branch office, as local circumstances may vary.

## Best Organized features

üìÉ **Schedules:** Automatic jw.org data fetch for scheduling midweek and weekend meetings, and more.

Ô∏èüìä **Reports:** Instant field service, attendance and congregation reports with accurate calculations of monthly and annual congregation reports.

üìÖ **Upcoming assignments:** View your next student, public talk and meeting assignments.

‚ö° **Autofill:** Automatically create assignments for any meeting in a matter of seconds. Organized takes into account a person's previous assignments, past partners and creates balanced meeting assignments.

üñ®Ô∏è **Print templates:** One-click export of schedules and forms (S-140, S-89, S-88, S-21, etc.), even offline. 

üé® **Modern user-focused design:** Well thought-out user experience, featuring dark and light modes, as well as four color themes.

üõú **Offline-use convenience:** Use the app offline. Your data syncs automatically when you reconnect.

## Device compatibility

Organized is a Progressive Web App (PWA) that runs in any modern browser: smartphone, tablet or desktop. PWAs combine the best of both web and native apps, making them fast, reliable, and convenient across multiple devices and platforms, and even work on less-powerful or niche devices. No operating system lock-in ‚Äì you get true full-app experience on any device, both at home and on-the-go.

No installation is required, but if you‚Äôd like a more native app-like experience (home-screen icon, no URL bar, etc.), just open Organized in your browser and accept the installation prompt (or tap `More/Share` button ‚Üí `Install`).

## Is Organized a cloud-based app?

In short, Organized is not a cloud-only app; it combines the flexibility of web access with the security and performance of a native app. You can access it in your browser or install it locally, but either way, all your data is stored on your device for offline use and better privacy. An internet connection is only needed to log in and securely sync shared data among your congregation users or your multiple devices; every transmission is end-to-end encrypted. Dive deeper into how the app works, its security, features, and other frequently asked questions on our [User guide](https://guide.organized-app.com/) page.

## Real-world benefits of using the app

üòå **Less stress** ‚Äì Have quick access to your assignments, schedules and congregation events. The app helps appointed brothers complete their responsibilities better, easier, and with more joy.

‚è≥ **Hundreds of saved hours** ‚Äì Automates reports, schedules and reminders. This saves you hundreds of hours of administrative/routine work and allows you to concentrate on what matters most.

üå≥ **Digitalization** ‚Äì Cut down on paper and ink waste. Instantly update information for the entire congregation, perform precise calculations on demand, and eliminate delays by reducing reliance on a presence of a specific brother.

üì±Ô∏è **Convenience** ‚Äì Enjoy full functionality seamlessly on any device ‚Äì whether it's mobile or desktop. Use Organized in your browser or install it locally on any smartphone, tablet or desktop. Enjoy the full app experience wherever you are.

Organized is a secure, open-source solution built on a local-first model: all your data lives on your device until you choose to sync it across multiple devices or share schedules with your congregation. When you do sync, only end-to-end encrypted information passes through our secure servers ‚Äì completely unreadable by anyone, including our team. Multiple layers of on-device encryption, two-factor authentication, one-time invitation codes and self-defined encryption keys protect your information at every step, while our publicly auditable codebase guarantees full transparency. 

**In compliance with GDPR**, we collect only the bare essentials (name, email, device ID and IP address) with your clear consent, and you always have the right to access, correct or delete your data.

_This project is tested with BrowserStack_
