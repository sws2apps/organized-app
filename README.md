## The app is open source and secure

All app data is stored just on your device initially. If you want to share your schedules with your congregation or use Organized on multiple devices, the data will be synced via a secure cloud connection. The app doesn't store any confidential information, so it's never sent to the Internet. The data required for synchronization is end-to-end encrypted, ensuring that **neither the Organized app team nor anyone on the Internet can't access it**.

## New features in development

We're working hard on the new redesigned release in the new branch _(current main one contains old, but fully functional version of the app)_. And there are so many features we want to implement:

‚Ä¢ Territories management

‚Ä¢ Meeting duties scheduling

‚Ä¢ Field service meeting scheduling and viewing

‚Ä¢ Upcoming events

‚Ä¢ Hall cleadning scheduling

‚Ä¢ Congregation activities

‚Ä¢ More printed schedules and forms (like S-13 and more)

We're excited about adding these and more other new features! Naturally, it takes time to develop them... If you know programming and want to help, we'd really appreciate it! Together we can create a better app for the brotherhood across the whole globe!
