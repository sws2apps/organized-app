## Who can use Organized?

The app is available for all congregation members, including elders, ministerial servants, pioneers, publishers, and even midweek meeting students ‚Äì everyone will see its benefits. However, we kindly suggest discussing its use with your body of elders, as local circumstances and directions may vary.

## What are the real benefits of using the app?

üòå Less stress ‚Äì Publishers always know when they have assignments, where to find all schedules and events. Appointed brothers have so much help with their duties, that they complete their tasks easier, therefore with more joy.

‚è≥ Hundreds of saved hours ‚Äì Significantly reduce time commitment for appointed brothers through automated features for reports, schedules and more! Don‚Äôt spend much time on a routine work that the program can do.

üå≥ Digitalization ‚Äì Less paper and ink waste for publishers and appointed brothers. Quicker updates of information for the whole congregation, more precise calculations and less dependancy on a specific appointed brothers.

üì±Ô∏è Convenience ‚Äì Enjoy full functionality seamlessly on any device ‚Äì whether it's mobile or desktop. Organized allows publishers and appointed brothers to use the app on any device, anywhere. You can access the app either from a web browser or install it for the best experience.


## What are the device requirements to open CPE?

Organized is a Progressive Web Application (PWA), meaning that it can function in any modern browser. Additionally, the app can be 'installed' to your home screen, providing quicker access and a better user experience.

## The app is open source and secure
All app data is stored just on your device initially. If you want to share your schedules with your congregation or use Organized on multiple devices, the data will be synced via a secure cloud connection. The app doesn't store any confidential information, so it's never sent to the Internet. The data required for synchronization is end-to-end encrypted, ensuring that **neither the Organized app team nor anyone on the Internet can't access it**.
