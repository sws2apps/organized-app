## Who Organized is made for?

The app is available for all congregation members, including elders, ministerial servants, pioneers, publishers, and even midweek meeting students ‚Äì everyone will see its benefits. However, we kindly suggest discussing its use with your body of elders, as local circumstances and directions may vary.

## Can my device run Organized? Device compatibility

Organized is designed as a Progressive Web Application (PWA), which is a huge benefit for a cross-platform experience and an advantage for users with less powerful devices or those using less common operating systems. This means that as long as you have a modern web browser, you can run Organized smoothly, whether you're on a smartphone, tablet, or computer with almost any OS.

To enhance your experience, you can also install Organized on your device. This adds an icon to your home screen, providing offline functionality and offering a more app-like experience, similar to native apps. Simply open the app in your device‚Äôs browser and follow the prompt to add it to your home screen.

Whether you're on the go or at home, Organized is easy to access and use, helping you manage your congregation tasks seamlessly ‚Äî anytime, anywhere, on any device!

## Real-world benefits of using the app

üòå **Less stress** ‚Äì Publishers always know when they have assignments, and where to find all schedules and events. Appointed brothers have so much help with their duties, that they complete their tasks more easily, therefore with more joy.

‚è≥ **Hundreds of saved hours** ‚Äì Significantly reduce time commitment for appointed brothers through automated features for reports, schedules, and more! Don‚Äôt spend much time on routine work that the program can do.

üå≥ **Digitalization** ‚Äì Less paper and ink waste for publishers and appointed brothers. Quicker updates of information for the whole congregation, more precise calculations, and less dependence on specific appointed brothers and their presence today.

üì±Ô∏è **Convenience** ‚Äì Enjoy full functionality seamlessly on any device ‚Äì whether it's mobile or desktop. Organized allows publishers and appointed brothers to use the app on any device, anywhere. You can access the app either from a web browser or install it for the best experience.

All app data is stored just on your device initially. The data will be synced via a secure cloud connection if you want to share your schedules with your congregation or use Organized on multiple devices. The app doesn't store any confidential information, so it's never sent to the Internet. The data required for synchronization is end-to-end encrypted, ensuring that neither the Organized app team nor anyone on the Internet can access it. In addition, all the data has multiple layers of data encryption on your device (so it's always pre-encrypted before it gets synced) and various security measures like two-factor authentication, congregation data ecryption, one-time invitation code, app PIN, and more!

## New features in development

We're working hard to help you manage your congregation tasks easily ‚ù§Ô∏è. Our goal is to create an app that covers all aspects of congregation life and ministry. While many features are already available, there are still plenty more we plan to add:

‚Ä¢ Territories management <br>
‚Ä¢ Meeting duties scheduling <br>
‚Ä¢ Field service meeting scheduling and viewing <br>
‚Ä¢ Upcoming events <br>
‚Ä¢ Hall cleaning scheduling <br>
‚Ä¢ Congregation activities <br>
‚Ä¢ More printed schedules and forms (like S-12, S-13, S-21, S-99, S-140 variations, and more) <br>

We're excited to add these new features and more! Development takes time, but if you're a web development enthusiast and want to help out, we'd love to have you on board. Together, we can make the app better for our worldwide brotherhood!
