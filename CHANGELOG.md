## The Organized App is released today!

After many months of dedication and hard work, we are excited to announce the release of **Organized** – the biggest app update ever! This update is designed to make congregation scheduling and responsibilities easier than ever before and build a solid foundation for big updates in the future. With the Organized app, fulfilling your responsibilities just became easy, efficient, and intuitive.

### ⚙️ Overview

This release represents a complete rewrite of the app, making it easier to use, much faster, and cleaner under the hood. We've revamped the user interface, speeding up the code behind the scenes so many tasks now take milliseconds instead of seconds. For some features, the performance is so fast that we even had to remove the loading indicator. The customization options are better than ever, and we’ve added several new features, including:

- **Auxiliary Pioneer Form**
- **Ministry Timer Widget**
- **Publisher Records**
- **Advanced Public Talk Scheduling Features**
- **Service Year Overview**
- **New Meeting Print Templates**
- **Many Data Now Available for S-Form Export**
- **Big Privacy & Security Updates**
- **And So Much More!**

The autofill system has been updated with new algorithms for faster, more accurate data entry. The app is now available in dozens of languages, making it easy to start using right away. In short, the app is brand new, allowing you to migrate your older data and start enjoying a much smoother and more efficient experience.
